            This application is created to make it easy for the collector to keep track of the needed coins to complete the collection.

        <h2>
            For a future improvement I want to make it so each collector has an account and can save how many coins he has from the collection. Maybe to make it possible for the account's holder to swap or sell the coins between them.
