# mvcCoins

This is a web application made for coins collectors. Here you have the information needed to start collecting UK coins, the coins that you use every day for shopping.


IT Technologies used: ASP.NET MVC(C#), MSSQL database, jquery


For a future improvement I want to make it so each collector has an account and can save how many coins he has from the collection. 
Maybe to make it possible for the account's holder to swap or sell the coins between them.
