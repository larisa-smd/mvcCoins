                <h3>50 pence coin</h3>
                <p>
                    Sir Isaac Newton was the intellectual giant of the seventeenth century’s ‘Scientific Revolution’.
                    He changed our understanding of mathematics and physics, redefined the way we see the world and shaped
                    the security of our currency in his role as Master of the Mint. In 2017, we celebrate his genius on a UK 50p.

                <p>
                    In 2017 we continue our First World War centenary commemorations with the fourth £2 coin, in a five-coin series, which honours the aviators of the First World War. At the outbreak of the First World War few people believed that aircraft would play a major role in the conflict.
